# Why Mike Antolin is interested in particular topics 

Here it is:

- I am interested in population genomic analyses, much like the leopard paper by Pecnerova et al (2021). 
    + One set of analyses will be to help my graduate student Robyn Bortner to characterize the genomics 
      from deep sequencing of sequencing of 17 black-footed ferrets that were collected at the time of 
      founding of the surviving captve breeding population.  Seven of these successfuly bred and were 
      the founders of the population, and are the progenitors of all ferrets that currently exist.
    + A second data set is not from deep sequncing, but from a popultion study of chronic wasting disease (CWD)
      in female mule deer.  The study spanned five years (2009-2013) and includes ~200 deer sampled 
      (radio-collared and recaptuerd) and evaluated for CWD infection.  
    + The deer were subjected to ddRAD sequencing, and were previously characterized for ~ 17,000 SNPs.  
    + Since that time, two reference genomes for mule deer have been created.  The re-analysis of the ddRAD data
      will be with respect to these reference genomes. I have access to the original raw sequences from the ddRAD 
      libraries, where locations of RAD-tags can be mapped to the reference genomes.
    + Although the full population genomic analysis will not be possible in the time frame or scope of this class,
      other data included: age, precise location data, CWD status and whether deer bacae infected upon recapture, 
      and Sanger-sequenced genotypes of of the deer for the Prion Precurser (PrP) gene (which affects potential 
      resistance of deer to CWD infection, ~ 750 bp CDS). 
    + I will ahve to learn to use the STACKS pipeline, which I presume will be able to be run as a linked series 
      of protocols using SNAKEMAKE (?).
