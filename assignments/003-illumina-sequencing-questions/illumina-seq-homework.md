These are the questions that appear in the video about Illumina sequencing by synthesis that
can be viewed at: [https://eriqande.github.io/erics-captioned-vids/vids/illumina-sbs/](https://eriqande.github.io/erics-captioned-vids/vids/illumina-sbs/).

Copy this template to a new file in the same directory called simply
`illumina-seq-homework.md`.  Please answer each question by typing in the space below each question, or by retaining the words corresponding to
your answers in the "dual-choice in parentheses" questions.

When you are done.  Save the file then commit it
to a branch called `illumina-seq` and push it back to your
fork of the course repo on GitHub then send me a pull request.



* Q1: True or False. This animation is showing that each of the two "fragments" is a double-stranded segment of DNA. (_from 30.0 to 33.0 seconds in the video_).

False



* Q2: How does the sequence of the fragment on top compare to the sequence of the fragment on the bottom? (_from 36.5 to 39.0 seconds in the video_).

The sequences are anti-parallel. The nucleotides of the top strand match the 
corresponding nucleotides of the bottom strand; 'A' correponsds to 'T', 'C' to 
'G', and vice versa.



* Q3: What is the purpose of the sequencing binding sites? Your answer should include the words "oligonucleotide," "polymerase," "3'-hydroxyl," and "synthesize." (_from 39.0 to 40.5 seconds in the video_).

The overarching purpose of the sequencing binding sites is to replicate DNA. 
Oligonucleotide primers bind to the template DNA strand and provides a 3'-hydroxyl
group. Inclusion of the 3'-hydroxyl group is important because DNA polymerase can
only synthesize DNA if it can attach bases to a free 3' hydroxyl on the end of the growing strand.



* Q4: Given the direction of travel of the polymerase, is the Original Template anchored to the lawn by its 3' or its 5' end? (_from 78.0 to 81.0 seconds in the video_).

3'


* Q5: How does the remaining strand relate to the Original Template? Is the remaining strand anchored by its 3' or 5' end? (_from 85.0 to 88.0 seconds in the video_).


This new strand is complementary to the original. 

It is anchored by the 5' end.



* Q6: Choose one from the parentheses: the purple part on the remaining strand is (the same as || complementary to) the purple lawn oligos.  (_from 88.2 to 92.2 seconds in the video_).

the same as


* Q7: Choose one from each set of parentheses: the blue part of the remaining strand is at the (3'|5') end and is (the same as|complementary to) the blue oligos on the lawn.  (_from 93.0 to 96.0 seconds in the video_).
 
3'

complementary to 





* Q8: The polymerase grows the new daughter strand from 5' to 3'.  Does that accord with your previous answers?  Make sure your answers are consistent with this. (_from 98.0 to 101.0 seconds in the video_).


I do think this is in accordance with my answers. 




* Q9: Choose one: Every oligo, purple or blue, on the lawn is attached by its (5'|3') end. (_from 105.0 to 109.0 seconds in the video_).

5'



* Q10: Choose one: Every blue or purple sequence dangling at the unattached end of a strand is at the (5'|3') end of the strand. (_from 109.0 to 113.0 seconds in the video_).

3'


* Q11: Is read 2 sequenced off the same strand as read 1? (_from 240.0 to 250.0 seconds in the video_).


No
