These are the questions that appear in the video about Illumina sequencing by synthesis that
can be viewed at: [https://eriqande.github.io/erics-captioned-vids/vids/illumina-sbs/](https://eriqande.github.io/erics-captioned-vids/vids/illumina-sbs/).

Copy this template to a new file in the same directory called simply
`illumina-seq-homework.md`.  Please answer each question by typing in the space below each question, or by retaining the words corresponding to
your answers in the "dual-choice in parentheses" questions.

When you are done.  Save the file then commit it
to a branch called `illumina-seq` and push it back to your
fork of the course repo on GitHub then send me a pull request.



* Q1: True or False. This animation is showing that each of the two "fragments" is a double-stranded segment of DNA. (_from 30.0 to 33.0 seconds in the video_).

False

* Q2: How does the sequence of the fragment on top compare to the sequence of the fragment on the bottom? (_from 36.5 to 39.0 seconds in the video_).

They run anti-parallel to each other with complementary nucleic acid sequences 

* Q3: What is the purpose of the sequencing binding sites? Your answer should include the words "oligonucleotide," "polymerase," "3'-hydroxyl," and "synthesize." (_from 39.0 to 40.5 seconds in the video_).

The purpose of the sequencing binding sites is that it is where DNA polymerase binds and can to synthesize a new DNA strand from the template. What is important is that there must be a free 3' hydroxyl for DNA polymerase to add new bases to the growing strand. What creates the free 3' hydroxyl group? Oligonucleotides! They attach to the template strand and provide the free 3' hydroxyl group which is recognized by the DNA polymerase for synthesis to begin. 

* Q4: Given the direction of travel of the polymerase, is the Original Template anchored to the lawn by its 3' or its 5' end? (_from 78.0 to 81.0 seconds in the video_).

The original template is anchored to the lawn by its 3' end 

* Q5: How does the remaining strand relate to the Original Template? Is the remaining strand anchored by its 3' or 5' end? (_from 85.0 to 88.0 seconds in the video_).

The remaining strand is complementary to the original template. The remaining strand is anchored by its 5' end

* Q6: Choose one from the parentheses: the purple part on the remaining strand is (the same as || complementary to) the purple lawn oligos.  (_from 88.2 to 92.2 seconds in the video_).

The purple part of the remaining strand is complementary to the purple lawn oligos

* Q7: Choose one from each set of parentheses: the blue part of the remaining strand is at the (3'|5') end and is (the same as|complementary to) the blue oligos on the lawn.  (_from 93.0 to 96.0 seconds in the video_).

The blue part of the remaining strand is at the 3' end and is complementary to the blue oligos on the lawn

* Q8: The polymerase grows the new daughter strand from 5' to 3'.  Does that accord with your previous answers?  Make sure your answers are consistent with this. (_from 98.0 to 101.0 seconds in the video_).

Yes

* Q9: Choose one: Every oligo, purple or blue, on the lawn is attached by its (5'|3') end. (_from 105.0 to 109.0 seconds in the video_).

Every oligo, purple or blue, on the lawn is attached by its 5' end

* Q10: Choose one: Every blue or purple sequence dangling at the unattached end of a strand is at the (5'|3') end of the strand. (_from 109.0 to 113.0 seconds in the video_).

Every blue or purple sequence dangling at the unattached end of a strand is at the 3' end of the strand

* Q11: Is read 2 sequenced off the same strand as read 1? (_from 240.0 to 250.0 seconds in the video_).

No, read 2 is sequenced off the reverse strand
