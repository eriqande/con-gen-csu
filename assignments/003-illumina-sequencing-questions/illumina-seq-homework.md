These are the questions that appear in the video about Illumina sequencing by synthesis that
can be viewed at: [https://eriqande.github.io/erics-captioned-vids/vids/illumina-sbs/](https://eriqande.github.io/erics-captioned-vids/vids/illumina-sbs/).

Copy this template to a new file in the same directory called simply
`illumina-seq-homework.md`.  Please answer each question by typing in the space below each question, or by retaining the words corresponding to
your answers in the "dual-choice in parentheses" questions.

When you are done.  Save the file then commit it
to a branch called `illumina-seq` and push it back to your
fork of the course repo on GitHub then send me a pull request.



* Q1: True or False. This animation is showing that each of the two "fragments" is a double-stranded segment of DNA. (_from 30.0 to 33.0 seconds in the video_).

FALSE (Well, each strand in the video is actually a complementary piece of one fragment of double-stranded DNA. So, FALSE?)

* Q2: How does the sequence of the fragment on top compare to the sequence of the fragment on the bottom? (_from 36.5 to 39.0 seconds in the video_).

The top and bottom fragment pieces are complementary strands of a double-stranded piece of DNA sequence. Each nucleotide in the top strand will join with its complement (A-T, C-G) in the bottom strand. They are in reverse directions to each other on the backbone, one 3' - 5' and one 5' - 3'. 

* Q3: What is the purpose of the sequencing binding sites? Your answer should include the words "oligonucleotide," "polymerase," "3'-hydroxyl," and "synthesize." (_from 39.0 to 40.5 seconds in the video_).

The sequencing binding site allows DNA polymerase to begin DNA synthesis by providing a free 3' hydroxyl group on the growing end of the strand that the polymerase can attach a new nucleotide to, based on the sequence provided by the complement. It comes after the oligonucleotides that allow the strand to attach to the lawn. 

* Q4: Given the direction of travel of the polymerase, is the Original Template anchored to the lawn by its 3' or its 5' end? (_from 78.0 to 81.0 seconds in the video_).

DNA is synthesized in the 5' - 3' direction. Therefore, we conclude that the Template must be anchored by it's 3' end (because the template would be read 3' -5'). 

* Q5: How does the remaining strand relate to the Original Template? Is the remaining strand anchored by its 3' or 5' end? (_from 85.0 to 88.0 seconds in the video_).

The remaining strand is the sequence complement to the template strand, with the matching A-T and C-G bases depending on the template sequence. It runs the opposite direction to the template, and so is anchored by it's 5' end. 

* Q6: Choose one from the parentheses: the purple part on the remaining strand is (the same as || complementary to) the purple lawn oligos.  (_from 88.2 to 92.2 seconds in the video_).

Complementary

***Update: So, I chose 'complimentary' because at 1:11 they say 'This oligo is complimentary to the adapter region on one of the fragment strands'. HOWEVER now that you brought that up, and I watched it again for the 138th time (lol), I see what you are asking. The purple part left on this strand IS the oligo that was on the lawn in the first place! The previous complement was washed away. I understand now ðŸ™‚ You really have to look for the little stems on the oligos in the video to keep track of them!

* Q7: Choose one from each set of parentheses: the blue part of the remaining strand is at the (3'|5') end and is (the same as|complementary to) the blue oligos on the lawn.  (_from 93.0 to 96.0 seconds in the video_).

3', complementary (I think, they used the word 'hybridize' which was weird)

* Q8: The polymerase grows the new daughter strand from 5' to 3'.  Does that accord with your previous answers?  Make sure your answers are consistent with this. (_from 98.0 to 101.0 seconds in the video_).

Yes. the remaining strand after synthesis had a 3' end free. This end folded over to anchor to the lawn and act as the next template, and so the new daughter strand was built as a complement from 5'-3'. As it should be :-)

* Q9: Choose one: Every oligo, purple or blue, on the lawn is attached by its (5'|3') end. (_from 105.0 to 109.0 seconds in the video_).

5'

* Q10: Choose one: Every blue or purple sequence dangling at the unattached end of a strand is at the (5'|3') end of the strand. (_from 109.0 to 113.0 seconds in the video_).

3'

* Q11: Is read 2 sequenced off the same strand as read 1? (_from 240.0 to 250.0 seconds in the video_).

No, it is the complement of strand 1, now being used as the new template.
