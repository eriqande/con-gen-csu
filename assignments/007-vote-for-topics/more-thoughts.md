# High ranked topics:
The highest ranked topics for me are all related to analyses that I will need to tackle in the next several months!
Creating workflows for identifying sex-linked scaffolds will be particularly useful for my projects.
Also, building QA/QC steps into a WGS pipeline that identifies relatedness and missingness among samples would be very useful.

# Other topics:
It would be awesome if we could spend any amount of time talking about linkage disequilibrium. Specifically, using ngsLD to calcualte r^2 among pairs of loci, and how to best visualize and interpet the results.
