I don't have too many thoughts or requests beyond what you've already presented to vote on.

I am especially interested in our class topics of RoH, PCA, and genome-wide associations because it will be directly useful for my research. 

I've seen so many PCA plots in papers--it would be so cool to make my own with my own data!

Other topics I would find very interesting might be estimating mean kinship and relatability--again, topics I hope to discuss about my ferret samples for my thesis!

Everything else will just be very interesting to learn!
