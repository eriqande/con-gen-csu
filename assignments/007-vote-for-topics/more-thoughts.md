Syllabus topics I liked:
GWAS: I would really like to learn how to to do a GWAS because I think studying local adaptation is really interesting.
I highly doubt I will be able to do one with my data ever because I wont have enough sample points, so doing it in class would give me some experience with it.

Coalescent and SFS: 
Similarly, I think the concepts involved are really interesting and I think it's a useful tool to know.
Again, I don't think I will ever do these with my own systems because my sample sizes will likely be too small, so I appreciate gaining any experience in class.

Topics I would like covered: I would appreciate some coverage -doesn't have to be an entire lesson either- on dealing with reduce representation data and without a reference genome. 
It is possible I will work with these data for my thesis so having a starting point to work from would be very helpful for me.
