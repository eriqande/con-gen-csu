I chose to rank the following three topics the highest:

PSMC

D-statistics

IBS-based analyses: neighbor joining tree

This was mainly because I do not know how to do these analyses and think it could be super helpful in my research to be able to look at effective population size over time, detect gene flow between distinct populations, and create a phylogenetic tree for the distinct species and subspecies within some of the more diverse families of amphibians I study. My research looks at changes in amphibian community richness and genetic diversity over time, so being able to use these tools to create a picture of population trends in my different species of interest would be extremely beneficial to me. I also am interested to learn how the neighbor-joining tree differs from other phylogenetic reconstruction methods. Overall though, I will be excited to tackle any of the topics from this paper in more depth. I have a lot to learn about analyzing genomic data still, and am ready to continue being challenged over the next several weeks of the semester.
