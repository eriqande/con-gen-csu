I have already been working with PCAngsd, SFS, and NGSadmix so they are lower on the priority list for me.
I would like a more in-depth understanding of GWAS.
IBS and D-statistics would be interesting to learn more about.
I'm also interested in learning more about evalAdmix, and if it might be something to test out with the river-herring samples.
