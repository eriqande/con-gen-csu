I thought the topics about Fst values were really interesting and applied to my work as I consider genetic diversity between lowland and highland-adapted deer mice (same population!). In addition, I'm interested in learning about GWAS analyses as they pertain to the adaptation of complex traits (ie. gestational adaptation to high elevation).

I would like to learn more about the Identity-by-state (IBS) analysis and related analyses (NJ tree & EEMS). The reconstruction of migration surfaces was too cool!

Other topics: 
GWAS!
Or linkage disequilibrium
