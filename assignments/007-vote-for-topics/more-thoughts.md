Since I'm not involved with any research right now I just ranked them based on what I found most intriguing. Syllabus wise I chose genome wide association studies and inbreeding, mostly because I have some sort of familiarity with those topics and I would like to know more about the bioinformatics side. For the leopard paper topics there was so much to chose from and they are all great topics but I tried to rank them based off what I may encounter in my career first. I did end up ranking the IBS-based anaylsis pretty high though mostly because I thought that would be pretty cool to be able to do, but seems a little more difficult perhaps.
