I chose to rank the following three topics the highest:

PSMC

D-statistics

IBS-based analyses: neighbor joining tree

This was mainly because I do not know how to do these analyses and think it could be super helpful in my research to be able to look at effective population size over time, detect gene flow between distinct populations, and create a phylogenetic tree for the distinct species and subspecies within some of the more diverse families of amphibians I study. My research looks at changes in amphibian community richness and genetic diversity over time, so being able to use these tools to create a picture of population trends in my different species of interest would be extremely beneficial to me. I also am interested to learn how the neighbor-joining tree differs from other phylogenetic reconstruction methods. Overall though, I will be excited to tackle any of the topics from this paper in more depth.


Regarding the general course topics, the three that most interested me were:

Genome wide association studies

PCA with lcWGS; PCAngsd

and

Inbreeding; runs of homozygosity.

I chose the first topic because another aspect of my thesis research is amphibian infectious disease caused by a pathogenic fungus. This fungus differentially affects distinct amphibian species and even varies in infection intensity among populations, so genome wide association studies could be a useful predictor of some of the genetic factors underlying variability in infection. A lot of my genetic samples will be either very small (a single frog toe) or degraded (several decades old), so anything related to lcWGS is of interest to me as well, but I would particularly like to learn how to use PCAngsd. And finally, in comparing genetic diversity over time and how it relates to the accumulation of deleterious alleles and population crashes, inbreeding depression is a very important thing to test for. Again, though, I am certain that any of the listed topics will be beneficial to explore in class; I have a lot to learn about analyzing genomic data still, and am ready to continue being challenged over the next several weeks of the semester.
