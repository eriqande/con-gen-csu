# PSMC
## very interested in learning more about how to prep data to implement this analysis because I will be using either 
## PSMC or SMC++ for my thesis

# SFS with lcWGS data
## I am also hoping to incorporate more lc data from Dr. Whitely to integrate with my hcWGS samples much like this 
## paper did with a few distinguished individuals 

# ROH and genome wide heterozygosity
## I am likely implementing a ROH / heterozygosity analysis in my thesis as well to look at potential inbreeding 
## and genetic diversity levels between the populations and species of cutthroat trout in my study to gain more info
## on their demographic / evolutionary histories
