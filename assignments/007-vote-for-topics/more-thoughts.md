Hi Eric, Super cool paper. The application of the NJ tree was really cool. I haven't seen that before in a population paper (although i'm new to this field). I was under the impression that NJ algorithms were perfomred pretty poorly to ML or Bayes algorithms. I wonder why they chose a NJ approach? I guess if they're working with whole genomes it'd be really time consuming to use an MCMC approach? Anyhow really rad stuff in here. Lots to think about.
