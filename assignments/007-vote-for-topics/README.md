# 007-vote-for-topics

Your homework over spring break is to thoroughly read [this paper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eriqande/con-gen-csu/main/extras/leopard-paper-and-supplements.pdf)
about leopard genetics, and then weigh in on which topics you would most like to discuss/cover
in the remaining weeks of the course.

Here is how you do it:

- Sync your fork and pull main to your clone.
- Create a new branch off of main called `007-rock-the-vote`
- On that branch do the following work:
    + Update the file `syllabus-topics.csv` in this directory, replacing the 0's in the first
      column with your own ranking of how interested you are in each of these topics. 1 = most
      interested, and 6 = least interested.  **Note: this file is a CSV file.  Make sure you
      preserve the commas in there and do not introduce any spurious spaces, etc.** Here is what the
      file looks like before you edit it: [syllabus-topics.csv](https://github.com/eriqande/con-gen-csu/blob/main/assignments/007-vote-for-topics/syllabus-topics.csv)
    + Update the file `leopard-paper-topics.tsv`.  There are 18 different topics we might discuss
      further in the class (and implement snakemake workflows for), taken from the leopard paper
      section headings.  We can't do all of them.  Rank each one from 1 to 6.  1 = most interesting to
      you and 6 = least interesting.  Assign three of each rank (three 1's, three 2's, three 3's three 4's
      three 5's, and three 6's, for a total of 18). **Note: this file is a CSV file.  Make sure you
      preserve the commas in there and do not introduce any spurious spaces, etc.** Here is what the
      file looks like before you edit it: [leopard-paper-topics.tsv](https://github.com/eriqande/con-gen-csu/blob/main/assignments/007-vote-for-topics/leopard-paper-topics.csv)
    + Create an additional file called `more-thoughts.md` and write in there why you are interested in the
      topics that you ranked high.  (This has to be neither long nor literary---just bang out a few thoughts)
      and then write down any other topics that you would love to see covered in the last half of the course
      (no guarantees! but I am curious to hear what sorts of things people are interested in).
- Once done with that, commit the files `syllabus-topics.tsv`, `leopard-paper-topics.tsv`, and
  `more-thoughts.md` in this directory.  Then push that up and send Eric a pull request.


Note that you can do all of this from a web browser on GitHub.  Even on a phone, if you are traveling.

**Have a great spring break**
