#### The "Getting To Know Unix" Problem Set   ####

# In the following, are questions/exercises/problems labelled like:

#### Ex. X: 

# where X is a number indicating which exercise it is.

# The question itself is written as a comment. (i.e., it follows the #)
# I would like you to figure out what the answer is, by playing around
# in the terminal. Once you have figured out the correct command line,
# write it beneath the question. Then, print the output of your
# command line beneath five dashes.

# I provide an answer for questions 1 and 2 as examples of what we I mean.

# NOTE: In much of the following I use backticks (`) to delimit strings that
# you are supposed to type.  When typing these strings, please do not include
# the backticks!!


#### Ex. 1:`cd` to your home directory and print its path

cd ~
pwd

-----

/Users/eriq


#### Ex. 2:  Use echo to print `my name is xxxx` to stdout.  Where `xxxx` is 
####        replaced by your name

echo "my name is Eric"

------

my name is Eric



#### Ex. 3:  Now, for real print your name, as in Ex. 2, but put your name in there:

echo "my name is Brian"

-----

my name is Brian


#### Ex. 3.1 Change directories to the assignments/002-unix-intro directory in the con-gen-csu repo

cd /projects/bavila@colostate.edu/con-gen-csu/assignments/002-unix-intro/

#### Ex. 3: print the absolute path of the directory 002-unix-intro that you just changed into

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ pwd
/projects/bavila@colostate.edu/con-gen-csu/assignments/002-unix-intro


#### Ex. 4: list, in long format, all the files and directories in this homework directory

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ ls -l

#### Ex. 8: If you wanted to type `ls fastq/DPCh_plate1_A06_S6.R1.fq.gz`
####        on the command line, what is the fewest keystrokes that can
####        get you `fastq/DPCh_plate1_A06_S6.R1.fq.gz` using TAB completion?

Including the pace bar and the tab key presses it takes 13 key strokes with the TAB completion to get:
  
  ls fastq/DPCh_plate1_A06_S6.R1.fq.gz
  
  Process is as follows:
  ls f(TAB)
  ls fastq/D(TAB)
  ls fastq/DPCh_plate1_A06(TAB)
  ls fastq/DPCh_plate1_A06_S6(TAB)
  ls fastq/DPCh_plate1_A06_S6.R1(TAB)


#### Ex. 9: Make a new directory called `lonely-fastqs`, and inside of that,
####        two directories R1 and R2.

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ mkdir -p lonely-fastqs/R1 lonely-fastqs/R2
[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ ls lonely-fastqs/
R1/  R2/


#### Ex. 10: Copy (not move) all the read1 (`R1`) fastq files in `fastqs`
####         into `lonely-fastqs/R1` and all the read2 fastqs into 
####         `lonely-fastqs/R2`. When you are done, list the contents of 
####         `lonely-fastqs/R1` and `lonely-fastqs/R2`

#### Ex. 12: Use the recursive (-r) option to remove `lonely-fastqs`
####         and its contents

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ rm -r lonely-fastqs/

#### Ex. 13: Make two new directories in the top level of the
####         repo called `fq_AB` and `fq_notAB`

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ cd ..
[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 assignments]$ cd ..
[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 con-gen-csu]$ mkdir fq_AB fq_notAB


#### Ex. 14: Using the `[` `]` copy the R1 files in `fastqs` that
####         belong to sample names (the part immediately after `DPCh_plate1_`)
####         starting with an `A` or `B` to `fq_AB`.

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ cp fastq/DPCh_plate1_[A-B]* /projects/bavila@colostate.edu/con-gen-csu/fq_AB/


#### Ex. 15: Now, using negation (`^`) with `[` and `]` copy all the
####         R1 files that don't belong to sample names starting with an
####         `A` or a `B` to `fq_notAB`. When you are done, on the next line in
####         the code block, list the contents of `fq_AB` and `fq_notAB`.

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ cp fastq/DPCh_plate1_[^AB]* /projects/bavila@colostate.edu/con-gen-csu/fq_notAB/

#### Ex. 16: Remove `fq_AB` and `fq_notAB`, and their contents

# Just to be safe I put the direct pathway of exactly what I want removed so there wasn't any OOPs... I could have dont it with:
# rm -r /projects/bavila@colostate.edu/con-gen-csu/fq_*
[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ rm -r /projects/bavila@colostate.edu/con-gen-csu/fq_AB/ /projects/bavila@colostate.edu/con-gen-csu/fq_notAB/

#### Ex. 17: Using the `{,}` construct create five directories named 
####         `dir_A`, `dir_C`, `dir_E`, `dir_G`, and `dir_I`, and list them
####         (but not their contents) when you are done. (Think `ls -d`).

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ mkdir dir_{A,C,E,G,I}/
[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ ls
bam/		 dir_A/  dir_E/  dir_I/  metadata/  silly/
count_files.sh*  dir_C/  dir_G/  fastq/  sam/	    unix-intro-TEMPLATE.sh


#### Ex. 18: Using globbing, remove `dir_A`, `dir_C`, `dir_E`, `dir_G`, and `dir_I`,
####         using a command with 8 characters (including spaces)

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ rm -r d*

#### Ex. 19: Create a directory called `nice_dir_name` and then use `echo`,
####         redirecting its output to create a file called `nice_file_name`
####         inside of `nice_dir_name` whose contents is the string
####         `A string in a file!`

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ echo 'A string in a file!' > /projects/bavila@colostate.edu/con-gen-csu/assignments/002-unix-intro/nice_dir_name/nice_file_name

#### Ex. 20: Catenate the contents of `nice_dir_name/nice_file_name` to _stdout_

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ cat nice_dir_name/nice_file_name
A string in a file!


#### Ex. 21: Create a directory called `bad directory name with spaces`, and then,
####         with redirection, create a file inside it, named 
####         `bad file name with spaces` whose contents are the string
####         `Whoa! No spaces, please!`. Use backslash escaping instead of quoting

# Ouch so much work... you made your point......

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ echo 'Whoa! No spaces, please!' >bad\ directory\ name\ with\ spaces/bad\ file\ name\ with \ spaces




#### Ex. 22: Catenate the contents of 
####         `bad directory name with spaces/bad file name with spaces` to stdout.

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ cat bad\ directory\ name\ with\ spaces/bad\ file\ name\ with\ spaces
Whoa! No spaces, please! 

#### Ex. 23: List the directories (just the names, not the contents (`-d`)) of
####         `bad directory name with spaces` and `nice_dir_name`.

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ ls -d bad\ directory\ name\ with\ spaces/ nice_dir_name/
bad directory name with spaces//  nice_dir_name//


#### Ex. 24: Once you are convinced that you can list the directories
####         correctly in your terminal, recall that `ls` command (i.e. get it back on the
####         command line using the up arrow on your keyboard) and replace `ls` with
####         `rm -r` to remove them. BE CAREFUL with the rm command!

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ rm -d bad\ directory\ name\ with\ spaces/ nice_dir_name/


#### Ex. 25: Why is it a good idea to `ls` things before removing them?

You want to make sure you can see what changed.  You also want to make sure you are in the correct location and you are removing what you want to remove.


#### Ex. 26: If you had just typed `rm -r bad directory name with spaces` 
####         what would Unix have tried to remove? (No command to type here,
####         just answer the question).

Unix would try to remove 5 seperate directories 1) bad/ 2) directory/ 3) name/ 4) with/ 5) spaces/


#### Ex. 27: There are bam, sam, and fastq files, in the appropriately
####         named directories for sample `A05_S5`. Make a directory named `A05_S5`
####         and copy all those files into that new directory. List the directory
####         when you are done.

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ cp bam/*A05_S5* fastq/*A05_S5* sa
m/*A05_S5* A05_S5/
[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ ls A05_S5/
DPCh_plate1_A05_S5.bam	     DPCh_plate1_A05_S5.R2.fq.gz
DPCh_plate1_A05_S5.R1.fq.gz  DPCh_plate1_A05_S5.sam

#### Ex. 28: remove the directory `A05_S5` and its contents

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ rm -r A05_S5/

#### Ex. 29: Use `ls` to try to list the file `it_aint_here`

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ ls it_aint_here
ls: cannot access it_aint_here: No such file or directory

#### Ex. 30: Now, do the same thing but redirect _stderr_ into a file called 
####         `my_bad.txt`, and then catenate the contents of that file, and then remove it

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ ls it_aint_here 2> my_bad.txt
[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ cat my_bad.txt
ls: cannot access it_aint_here: No such file or directory

#### Ex. 33: What do you notice about the names of the two reads in each

The only thing that I can notice that is different is that they are the same but have a /1 or /2 at the end depending on which read they came from.


#### Ex. 34: Print the date, redirect it to a file called `now.txt`,

#### Ex. 37: Now, gzcat all the `R1` files in `fastq` and redirect that
####         to a file called `R1_all_via_gzcat.fq` in the top directory of the repo

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ zcat fastq/*.R1.* > /projects/bavila@colostate.edu/con-gen-csu/R1_all_via_gzcat.fq

#### Ex. 38: People are usually familiar with using `cat` to catenate text
####         files. It turns out that you can also catenate `gzip` compressed files. 
####         The result is another properly gzipped file that can be decompressed. 
####         Catenate all the gzipped `R1` files in `fastq` into a single (still gzipped)

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ cat fastq/*.R1.* > R1_all_via_cat.fq.gz


#### Ex. 39: Copy `R1_all_via_cat.fq.gz` to `copy_of_R1_all_via_cat.fq.gz`

[bavila@colostate.edu@login11 002-unix-intro]$ gunzip R1_all_via_cat.fq.gz


#### Ex. 41: Compute the SHA1 hashes of `R1_all_via_cat.fq` and `R1_all_via_gzcat.fq`
####         to confirm they are identical

# Note: alpine didn't have shasum on it.  Moved to my Mac... because I have less problems on my mac.

#### Ex. 52: Use chmod to change permissions of the files in the `silly`
####         directory to match their names. For example for the first 
####         one you would use: `chmod 770 FILE-rwxrwx---`. Use the octal
####         specifiers to `chmod`. Do this for all 5 files (one chmod command for each),
####         and at the end do `ls -l silly` to verify they are correct.
