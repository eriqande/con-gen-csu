# here is what I used to install bwa-mem2 into its own environment
# (This was not required in this file, but i thought I would put it in here anyway)
mamba create -n bwa-mem2 -c bioconda bwa-mem2


# launch the trim job
sbatch assignments/005-slurm-and-bwa-mem2/trim_all.sh


# launch the index job
sbatch assignments/005-slurm-and-bwa-mem2/index2.sh data/genome/genome.fasta


# launch the map job:
# The typical way would be to do this:
sbatch  assignments/005-slurm-and-bwa-mem2/map2.sh

# but I wanted to test it with the first two array tasks first, so I did:
sbatch --array=1,2 assignments/005-slurm-and-bwa-mem2/map2.sh

# then, when I saw that those completed correctly, I did:
sbatch --array=3-16 assignments/005-slurm-and-bwa-mem2/map2.sh


# finally, I made the sha1 hashes:
sha1sum results/mapped2/*.bam > assignments/005-slurm-and-bwa-mem2/bam_sha1s.txt
