## This is the config file that determnines what analyses will
## be run on which sample subset from which parent BCF.

# This file is intended to be run in mega-post-bcf directory
# in which there is a sym link to the directory
# con-gen-csu/extras/mega-post-config-and-data that is
# named MPCD

#### MODULES SECTION

# This is what you would use on Alpine
Rmodule: "R/4.2.2"

# This is what you would use on SEDNA
# Rmodule: "R/4.0.3"

#### DEFINITIONS SECTIONS #####

# every BCF file used here must correspond to the same
# reference genome and thus to the same scaffold groups file.
# These are identified here:
fai_path: MPCD/resources/genome.fasta.fai
scaff_group_path: MPCD/config/scaffold_groups.tsv



# this is the short name and the path to the BCF file that will be used
# the key here (testy) corresponds to wildcard {bcf_id}.  The sample subsets
# should, of course, correspond to a particular
# bcf file, so they go here.  If there are meta data files for association
# studies using the GLM in ANGSD, these go here as the dotsample.
# 
bcf:
  chinook_16:
    path: "MPCD/data/chinook-16-all-filtered.vcf.gz"
    sample_subsets:

        dotsample: MPCD/sample_subsets/dot-samples-all-fish.tsv





# same thing here, we can define different sets of bcftools filters
# that we might want to use, and we give them nicknames. The 
# nicknames/keys here correspond to wildcard

# from GitHub we would like to get

#### PARAMETERS SECTION
# Here we can give some short names for different sets of parameters
# that we will use later for particular ultimate targets

# these are all the standard parameters in the file paths.  The maf
# is for programs like ANGSD or PCAngsd or ngsAdmix that allow for
# MAF filtering within the program.  Will have no effect in programs
# that do not do MAF filtering, but might still be in their ouput paths...

#### TARGETS SECTION

# here we have a shorthand for describing target outputs.
# Each output is defined by a triple: [A, B, C] that lives under
# a heading which says which kind of analysis is desired.
# where 
#   - A is a nickname from main_params
#   - B is a nickname for a subsample that is appropriate to the BCF in A
#   - C is a nickname for the parameters defined in params for the particular analysis
#
# The idea here is that each of these triples can be used to define a file name
# or possibly multiple filenames.
