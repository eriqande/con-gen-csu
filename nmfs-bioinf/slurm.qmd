# Sedna and SLURM intro {#ssintro}

- SLURM stands for "Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management"
- It is the "queueing system" used to equitably provide compute resources
on the Sedna HPCC.

## Why do we need SLURM?

- The fundamental problem of cluster computing.
- A cluster does not operate like your laptop.
- Most compute-intensive jobs run most efficiently on a dedicated processor
or processors.


## HPCC Architecture in a Nutshell

![](images/hpcc-diagram.jpg)

- **Nodes**: the closest thing to what you think of as a computer. ("Pizza-boxes" with no displays).
    - Each node is attached via a fast connection to centralized attached storage (A big set of hard drives
      attached via "Infiniband.")
    - Within each node are some numbers of **Cores** or **CPUs**
        - Cores/CPUs  are the actual processing units _within a node_. (Usually 20 to 24)
- Sedna, like almost all other HPCCs has a _login node_
    - The _login node_ is dedicated to allowing people to communicate with the HPCC.
    - DO NOT do computationally intensive, or input/output-intensive jobs on the _login node_
    - Not surprisingly, when you login to Sedna you are on the login node.

## Hot tip!

In the default configuration on Sedna, your command prompt at the shell
tells you which node you are logged into.  The default command prompt looks
like:
```{.sh}
[username@computer directory]
```
So, for example, mine at the moment is:
```{.sh}
[eanderson@sedna playground]$
```
Which tells me that I am user `eanderson` and I am logged in to `sedna` in the
directory whose basename is `playground`.

The login node for Sedna is named `sedna`.  So, this is telling
me that I am logged into the _login node_ of Sedna.

**If you don't have such an informative prompt...**

On Alpine, I am not sure what the default command prompt is, but you can always change
yours by setting the `PS1` variable.  Try doing:
```{.sh}
export PS1='[\h: \W]--% '
```
That will give you a command prompt with the _hostname_ (`\h`) and the
working directory basename (`\W`), which is helpful.  Mine, right now,
looks like:
```{.sh}
[login11: con-gen-csu]--%
```

Of course, you can put the `export PS1='[\h: \W]--% '` into your `~/.bashrc` file
and then always have an informative prompt.

## Self study

Investigate your own command prompt and make sure you understand what
the different parts in it mean.

## Say it again: Don't do heavy computing on the login nodes!

If you run a big job that is computationally intensive on the login node,
it can interfere with other people being able to access the cluster.

Don't do it!!

That is all fine and well, but how do we avoid computing on the
login nodes?

## Do your computation on the compute nodes

- To run jobs on the compute node you need to ask SLURM to
  give you "compute resources" to run the job.
- The basic axes of "compute resources" are:
    - The number of cores to use.
    - The maximum amount of RAM memory you might need.
    - The amount of time that you will need those resources for.
- To prepare for the next part of the course **on SEDNA**, each one of us is going
to "check out" 2 cores for 3 hours for _interactive_ work.
    - Interactive here means that we will have a Unix shell that has access
      to compute power on the cores that we checked out.

    - Here is the command to checkout 2 cores for 3 hours for interactive use:
    ```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell on SEDNA"}
    srun -c 2 -t 03:00:00 --pty /bin/bash
    ```
- If you are working **on ALPINE** then you can get on a compute node differently:
    - Load the `slurm/alpine` module
    - Request a shell on the oversubscribed `atesting` partition.
    - The commands for that look like:
    ```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell on ALPINE"}
    module load slurm/alpine
    srun --partition atesting --pty /bin/bash
    ```

::: {.callout-tip}

## Self study:

Have a look at your command prompt now.  If you are on SEDNA, it should show that you
are logged in to `nodeXX` where `XX` is a number like `04` or `33`. If you are on
Alpine, then the node you are on will be named something more cryptic, like
`c3cpu-a5-u34-3`.

## What does Sedna have under the hood?

Sedna is not an outrageously large cluster, but it is well-maintained
and provides a lot of computing power.

The nodes in Sedna are broken into three different _partitions_.

A _partition_ is a collection of nodes that tend to be similar.

- `node` partition: This is a collection of 36 nodes:
    - `node01` -- `node28`: "standard compute nodes"
    - `node29` -- `node36`: "standard compute nodes with twice as much memory"
- `himem` partition: Four nodes with a boatload of memory for high-memory jobs
    - `himem01` -- `himem04`
- `bionode` partition: legacy machines from an older NWFSC cluster
    - I'm not sure if all of us have access to this.
    - When I check, it seems like a lot of the nodes are down, occasionally.
    - But I have been able to checkout resources on it.
    - Might be an option, but it doesn't perform at the same level as the `node` partition
    

## What does ALPINE have under the hood?

Alpine is a pretty darn large cluster, with a boatload of different machines,
many of them with 64 cores.  It also has some GPU machines, etc.

We will have a look at it with the commands, like `sinfo` described next.


## Ask SLURM about what nodes are available, and how busy they are

When I login **to Sedna**, before launching and jobs or working on anything,
I always like to get a summary of how hard Sedna is currently working.

For this we have the `sinfo` command:
```{.sh filename="Type this at your command prompt"}
sinfo
```

The answer will look somethign like this:
```{.sh}
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
node*        up   infinite      5    mix node[01,29-31,33]
node*        up   infinite      1  alloc node32
node*        up   infinite     30   idle node[02-28,34-36]
himem        up   infinite      1    mix himem01
himem        up   infinite      3   idle himem[02-04]
bionode      up   infinite      8  down* bionode[10-11,13-18]
bionode      up   infinite      1  drain bionode12
bionode      up   infinite     10   idle bionode[01-09,19]
```

This is a hugely informative summary for being so compact.

- The output is sorted by partition.
- Within each partition it tells us how many nodes are in different states:
- The main states:
    - `idle`: just sitting there with all cores available for checkout,
    - `mix`: some, but not all, cores are checkout out and in use,
    - `alloc`: all the cores on the node are checkout out and in use.
- Other states you might see:
    - `down`: node is unavailable because it is not working properly,
    - `drain`: node is not available because the sys-admins are not letting
    any new jobs to start because they are going to be working on the system
    soon, etc.
- The `node` partition is starred `node*` because it is the default partition.
- Notation like `node[01,29-31,33]` gives the specific node numbers, compactly.


If you type `sinfo` **on ALPINE** you get a similar output, but it is much larger
and more complex because there are more partitions and more, different nodes in each
partition.  

The CURC lists the partitions on a web page 
[here](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/clusters/alpine/alpine-hardware.html#partitions).

If you are going to be working on Alpine, it is worth reading over the entire CURC documentation
for it, starting from [here](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/clusters/alpine/quick-start.html).

## Self-study

Review how many nodes are currently in use.

:::


## More detailed `sinfo` output

Sometimes you want more information about what is going on with the
cluster.  `sinfo` can do that, too, but the syntax is hard to remember
and even harder to type.  

Here is a bash function we will define called `slinfo` for (`s-long-info`) that 
uses `sinfo` to provide more detailed output. 

```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
function slinfo {
  sinfo -N -O nodelist,cpusstate,memory,allocmem
}
```
Once you have done that:
```{.sh filename="Type this at your command prompt"}
slinfo
```

This gives information about each node.

- In `CPUS(A/I/O/T)`:
  - A = allocated
  - I = idle
  - O = offline
  - T = total
- `MEMORY` is total RAM available on the node (in Megabytes)
- `ALLOCMEM` is the total RAM allocated to jobs.

This view shows each node just once.  But it might be useful to also see what
partition(s) each of those nodes are in (especially on ALPINE).  So, here is a quick function to do that:
```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
function slinfop {
  sinfo -N -O nodelist,partition,cpusstate,memory,allocmem
}
```
Once you have done that:
```{.sh filename="Type this at your command prompt"}
slinfop
```

Note that many nodes are included in multiple partitions.

Since the main partition on Alpine for general computing is `amilan` you can
look specifically at nodes in that partition with:
```{.sh filename="Copy this into your command prompt"}
slinfop | awk '$2~/amilan/'
```

::: {.callout-tip}

## ALPINE Self-study

Quickly scan the output of the above command and estimate the number
of idle (i.e. _available_) cores in the `amilan` partition.

Then, read about the `amilan` partition (here)[https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/clusters/alpine/alpine-hardware.html#partitions].
In particular, note how much memory is available per core, and the default and max wall times.

We will discuss this.

## Summarize what the cluster is doing _by job_

SLURM keeps track of individual jobs that get submitted.

For SLURM, each _job_ is basically a request for resources.

If SLURM finds the requested resources are available, it
provides the resources and starts the job.

If resources are not available because other jobs are running,
the reqested job enters the "queue" in a WAITING state.

We can see how many jobs are running and how many are
waiting, by using the SLURM `squeue` command:

(By the way, notice the pattern? All SLURM command start with
an `s`).

```{.sh filename="Type this at your command prompt"}
squeue
```

This tells us a little about all the jobs that are currently
allocated resources or are waiting for resources.

**One thing to note**: 
- Every job is assigned a `SLURM_JOB_ID`.
Which is a unique integer (that gets assigned successively).
- And jobs might have a job NAME, that is assigned by the user, which
is the name of the script that the job runs, or is defined in the
SBATCH directives (we will talk about that later!)

## I find the standard, default, `squeue` output sorely lacking

The standard way that `squeue` presents information is not super informative,
_especially_ if the job names are not very short, or if you are interested in how
many cores (not just nodes) each job involves.

Once again, we make a bash function, `alljobs`, that runs `squeue` but
provides more information.  
```{.sh filename="Paste this at your command prompt"}
function alljobs {
  if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    JL=10;
  else
    JL=$1;
  fi;
  squeue -o  "%.12i %.9P %.${JL}j %.15u %.2t %.15M %.6D %.18R %.5C %.12m %.12l %.12L";
}
```

Also, if you follow the command with an integer like `20`, that is how many spaces
the output will allow for the job NAME.  

For example, try:
```{.sh filename="Type this at the command prompt"}
alljobs 30
```


This is kind of fun to see the full names of the jobs.

::: {.callout-warning}

## Hot Tip!

It is worth taking special note of the columns, `NODELIST(REASON)` and
`CPUS`:

- `NODELIST(REASON)`: If the job is running, then this gives the name(s) of the
node(s) upon which it is running.  If it is not running, it says _why_ it is not
yet running. The most typical reason it:
    - `Priority`: Too many other users are already using the cluster.  Your job is
    waiting for resources to become available. 
- CPUS: the number of CPUs the job is using

It is worth noting that, when I look at `alljobs` on Alpine, most of the jobs that
are waiting due to `Priority` are jobs that are requesting all or most of the CPUs
(like 64 or 32) on a single node.  Many of the jobs that are _not_ waiting are those
that are requesting only one or a few cores.  

In general, if you can break your workflows down into a small chunks that run on just
one or a few cores, you have a better chance of getting compute time, than if
you request all the cores on a node.
  
:::



## Just tell me about my jobs!

We can make a similar function that only tells us about our own jobs
that are running or waiting in the queue:
```{.sh filename="Paste this into your terminal"}
function myjobs {
	if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
	  JL=10;
  else
	  JL=$1;
  fi;
	squeue -u $(whoami) -o  "%.12i %.9P %.${JL}j %.10u %.2t %.15M %.6D %.18R %.5C %.12m %.12l %.12L %p";
}
```

You can run that the same way as `alljobs`, and you should
see the 2-core job you started with `srun`:
```{.sh filename="Type this into your shell"}
myjobs
```


## Finding Software on a Cluster

- Analysis software is not automatically available on a cluster
- On many clusters you have to install it yourself
- On Sedna, we are very lucky to have a great support crew that
will install software for us, and also make it available for
everyone else to use.

However, software can be complicated:

- Some software might conflict with other software.
- Some users might want different software versions

The solution: maintain software (and its dependencies)
in (somewhat) isolated _modules_.

::: {.callout-important}

## Bioinformatic modules on Sedna are only available if the MODULEPATH is specified

Here we check to see if the bioinformatics paths are in the MODULEPATH:
```{.sh filename="Paste this in your shell"}
echo $MODULEPATH | grep bioinformatics
```

If that command did not return anything to `stdout`, then you need to
add a command to your `~/.bashrc` that will add `/opt/bioinformatics/modulefiles`
to your MODULEPATH. You can do that (as detailed in the [Sedna Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nn0T0OWEsQCBoCdaH6DSY69lQSbK3XnPlseyyQuU2Lc/edit#))
like this:
```{.sh filename="If you need to, paste this into the shell"}
echo 'export MODULEPATH=${MODULEPATH}:/opt/bioinformatics/modulefiles' >> ~/.bashrc
```
And when you are done with that, reload your `.bashrc` to get the change
to take effect:
```{.sh filename="If you need to, paste this into the shell"}
source ~/.bashrc
```
:::

Most modules on Alpine are only available if you are on a compute node.



## Example: Let's try running `samtools`

`samtools` is a common bioinformatic utility.

Typically, if you run it with no arguments, it gives you
some usage information.

However, on Sedna, unless you have installed `samtools` yourself,
or have set your environment up to always have it available,
when you type `samtools` at the shell, you will get a response saying
that it is not available:
```{.sh filename="Type this at the command prompt"}
samtools
```
The response I get from the computer is:
```{.sh}
bash: samtools: command not found...
```
You will likely get that response, too.

On Alpine, you could install `samtools` via `mamba` or you could
see if it is available in the system _modules_.

## Check which software programs are available in the modules

The command `module` and its subcommands let you interact with the
software modules.

`module avail` tells you what software is available in the modules.
```{.sh filename="Type this into your shell"}
module avail
```

On SEDNA, there is a lot of tasty bioinformatics software there.
On Alpine, there is now a dedicated "Bioinformatics" section in the
output of `module avail`, which is
a nice change from Alpine's predecessor, SUMMIT, which was mostly loaded up
with software for geoscientists.

The numbers are the version numbers.  The `(D)` after some of them
tells us that version is the default.

## Load the samtools module

We will load the module for version 1.15.1 of `samtools`.  That
can be done like this:

**SEDNA** 
```{.sh filename="On SEDNA, Paste this into your shell"}
module load bio/samtools/1.15.1
```

**Alpine** 
```{.sh filename="On Alpine, Paste this into your shell"}
module load samtools
```


(using the `load` subcommand of `module`)

::: {.callout-warning}

## About the default versions

The same would have been achieved with
```{.sh}
module load bio/samtools
```
because 1.15.1 is the default samtools version.

Nonetheless, it is typically best from a reproducibility
standpoint to be explicit about version numbers of
software you are using.

:::


Now, that it is loaded, you can run the `samtools` command and
get the usage message.

```{.sh filename="Type this at your shell"}
samtools
```

::: {.callout-warning }

## Inventory and Unload modules

To know which modules you have loaded:
```{.sh}
module list
```

To unload all the modules you have loaded
```{.sh}
module purge
```

There are many more module commands, but those are the only ones that
you really need to know.

:::


## Two notes about modules

::: {.callout-important }

## Loaded modules are only active in the current session

If you open a new shell, or allocate an interactive session on a new core,
or logout and log back in again...

...You will have to reload the modules that you need.

**So**: Any time you write a script that needs some software,
you should load the module for that software in the initial lines
of the script.

:::

::: {.callout-warning}

## Modules are not always portable

Not every cluster that you use will have the same
modules set up in the same way. (Though it does seem that Giles has
set the modules up on Sedna according to the accepted best practices!).

So, if you use code you developed for
Sedna (or Alpine) on another cluster, you might have to modify things to ensure that
software is available.  

The conda/mamba package manager is an option if you are going to be running
your scripts on different clusters.

:::

## If you need more software or newer versions on Sedna

You can request software installations by using the [Sedna work request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2tDl9nJjihmHX9hM6ytMI3ToldqERVem1ge25-kp3JHw3tQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)


## If you need more software or newer versions on Alpine

You probably can request it from the sys admins, but you will almost indubitably
have your required software up and running faster if you install it with mamba.

## Before we go, make our convenience functions available whenever we are on our cluster

We defined four convenience functions in bash: `slinfo`, `slinfop`, `alljobs`, and `myjobs`.  

Once we log out of the current session, or login to a different session, those
convenience functions will be lost.

To make sure that they are accessible the next time we login, we will put them
into our own `.bashrc` files.  

The `.bashrc` file is a file in your home directory in which you can put function
definitions and other configurations that will be applied whenever you open a new
bash shell.

To add our four convenience functions to your `.bashrc` file, first start
editing your `~/.bashrc` file with `nano`.
```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Then come back to this web page and copy
the following text:
```{.sh filename="Copy this onto your clipboard"}
function slinfo {
  sinfo -N -O nodelist,cpusstate,memory,allocmem
}

function alljobs {
	if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
	  JL=10;
  else
	  JL=$1;
  fi;
	squeue -o  "%.12i %.9P %.${JL}j %.15u %.2t %.15M %.6D %.18R %.5C %.12m %.12l %.12L";
}

function myjobs {
	if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
	  JL=10;
  else
	  JL=$1;
  fi;
	squeue -u $(whoami) -o  "%.12i %.9P %.${JL}j %.10u %.2t %.15M %.6D %.18R %.5C %.12m %.12l %.12L %p";
}

```


Then paste those function definitions into the editor in your .bashrc
file (before your conda/mamba block if you have one),
and then do `cntrl-X`, `Y`, `RETURN` to save the file
and get out of `nano`.

Now, the next time you login you will have all those functions.


## Bonus Thoughts --- What are other people doing?

Especially when you are working on a smaller workgroup cluster and
you are wondering if other users are using it efficiently, there are a few
ways you can check up on what they are doing.

Using `alljobs` you can see what other people are doing.  Then you can
`ssh` to the node that they are running jobs on, and then do
`ps -auxww | grep user` (where `user` is their username) and that will
show the currently running command lines.  This can be useful, for example, to see
if their jobs are multithreaded while they are using many cores or not.

You can also get information about failures on different nodes with
`dmesg -T`.
