#  Snakemake Tutorial Introduction {#snake}

- Snakemake is a Python-based system for orchestrating bioinformatic workflows.
- It is loosely based on the GNU utility `make` that was designed
for coordinating the compilation of large software projects.
- But, it is tailored to bioinformatic problems and it is _much_ easier
to use the `make` (in my opinion).
- Nonetheless, it has a bit of a learning curve.

Our goal today is to let y'all interact with Snakemake on a small
example project, to get a sense for some of its features.

This part of the presentation is structured as a set of slides,
rather than as a book.
