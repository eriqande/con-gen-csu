        "would like.  Briefy instructions on how to do that are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. In your web browser, go to [https://ondemand-rmacc.rc.colorado.edu/](https://ondemand-rmacc.rc.colorado.edu/).\n",
        "1. The first time you click that, it will take you to a page where you must choose which institution's\n",
        "OpenOnDemand infrastructure you are accessing.  Choose `Colorado State University`, from\n",
        "the pop-up menu and be sure to\n",
        "select \"Remember this selection\" and then click \"Log On\".  \n",
        "![](./images/colostate-open-ondemand.png)\n",
        "2. That should redirect you to your CSU NetID login page.  Authenticate yourself.\n",
        "3. That should drop you into the CURC OnDemand Dashboard page that looks like this:  \n",
        "![](./images/curc-on-demand-dashboard.png)\n",
        "4. Choose \"Interactive Apps-->RStudio Server Presets\", then use the bottom toggle\n",
        "box to choose \"4 cores, 4 hours\", and hit \"Launch\".  This will start making\n",
        "you an RStudio Server container.  Again, we choose 4 cores just for the initial\n",
        "setup, but you can choose 1 core in the future.  \n",
        "![](./images/rstudio-server-preset.png)\n",
        "5. Now, go to your \"Interactive Sessions\" and you will see messages about your\n",
