# Slurm Job Arrays {#slurm-arrays}

- The `sbatch` command takes an `--array=<array_spec>` option
that let's you quickly launch---and easily manage---different
instances of a single job that are all differentiated by
a unique integer.
- That integer is accessible within the script as the environment
variable `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`.
- We will see a little shell/awk script that is very helpful in
this context.


## Prepare for this session

Get on your cluster and navigate to the top level (`con-gen-csu`)
of your fork of the class repository. Then,
to make sure that you have all the latest updates from the repository,
sync the main branch of your fork with the main branch of
`eriqande/con-gen-csu` on GitHub, then in your shell, use
`git switch main` to make sure you are on the main branch of your
fork, and then use `git pull origin main` to pull down those changes.


## `sbatch`'s `--array` option

When you give `sbatch` the `--array=1-10` option, say, then
it runs your job 10 separate times, each time with the environment variable
`SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` set to a different number between
1 and 10.  

Let's see a quick example, using the following script:
```{r filename="Contents of scripts/array_example.sh"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| file: ../scripts/array_example.sh

```

This is helpful to see a few of the variables that are defined in the
environment of an array job:

- `SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID`: the overall JOB_ID for the whole array
- `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`: the index that runs from 1 to 10 in this case
- `SLURM_JOB_ID`: The underlying job_id 


One can run this script, but we don't want a whole classroom full of people
throwing all these jobs on the cluster. So, get into groups of three or four,
talk amongst yourselves about what you think this script will do, and then have just
one person from each group launch the job with the following command:
```{.sh filename="One person from each group, paste this into your shell"}
sbatch scripts/array_example.sh
```
And then use `myjobs` and `alljobs` to watch what is happening on the cluster.

When that job is done, or when it is running, look at the values written to the
first output files:
```{.sh filename="Paste this into you shell"}
head results/array_example/output_{1..10}.txt
```

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}

## Cool syntax interlude: `{1..10}`

On the shell, if you do something like:

- `{2..7}`: that will expand to `2 3 4 5 6 7`
- `{a..g}`: that will expand to `a b c d e f g`
- `{0001..0015}`: that will expand to `0001 0002 0003 0004 0005 0006 0007 0008 0009 0010 0011 0012 0013 0014 0015`
- `{F..M}`: that will expand to `F G H I J K L M`

:::

From looking at the array_example output files, we can infer that:

- `SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID`: is a unique number that refers to the _entire set_ of jobs in the array
- `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`: is the integer that is being cycled over in the array job
- `SLURM_JOB_ID`: is a unique SLURM_JOB_ID of the specific array task.

Also, in `alljobs` and `myjobs` you see that jobs can be referred to
like `331989_4`.  That is `SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID` + underscore + `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`.
For example: `scancel 376578_12`.

In the slurm output files specified like:
```{.sh}
SBATCH --output=my_output_%A_%a
```

- `%A` expands to `SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID`
- `%a` expands to `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`

If you need to cancel a particular array task using `scancel` you would
typically use `SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID` + underscore + `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`,
unless you wanted to cancel all remaining instances of an array task,
in which case you would use
```{.sh}
scancel SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID
```

## Variations on the `<array_spec>`

There are some important variations to how you can specify those
array numbers:

- `--array=1-50`: simple, consecutive numbers
- `--array=1-10:3`: 1 through 10 by threes, (so `1,4,7,10`)
- `--array=1,2,3,6,9,15` non-consecutive numbers
- `--array=1-21:10,100-200:50`: non-consecutive ranges.  It becomes (`1,11,21,100,150,200`)
- `--array=1-10,4`: WARNING, this becomes `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,4`.  SLURM does not check that
the array numbers are unique, so task array 4 would be run twice (possibly concurrently overwriting
the output.)
- `--array=1-20%5` VERY IMPORTANT SYNTAX:  Run the jobs, but don't ever have more the 5 running at a time.
This is useful for making sure your jobs don't consume every last CPU on Sedna.

Let's try putting all these together.  Read the following command and,
talking among the members of your group,
figure out what the array spec is doing. Then have one person from each
group submit the job with the following command:
```{.sh filename="One person from each group, aste this into your shell"}
sbatch --array=100,200,300-400:10%5 scripts/array_example.sh
```
Then use `myjobs` and `alljobs` to see what is going on in the cluster.

Do you ever have more than 5 jobs running?

## Translating Array Indexes to Job Instances

- The user is left to translate what a job array index of, say, 7, means in terms of what
  actions that array task should take.
- Quite often you will want to map an array index to a different file to analyze,
  or perhaps a different region of a chromosome to do variant calling on, etc.
- A flexible and generic way of doing this mapping from array indexes to job specifics
  is to first define the variables (things like filenames, etc.) required by each
  array task in a simple TAB-delimited text file in which the first row holds the
  names of the variables in different TAB-separated columns, and each row
  below that holds the values that those variables should take for different values of the array index.
- The array index itself should be listed in the first column, whose name is `index`.  

### An example TAB-delimited file

Let's explore the following file, which is at `data/sample-array-info.tsv`:
```{sh filename="Contents of data/sample-array-info.tsv"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| file: ../data/sample-array-info.tsv

```

An easier way to view this might be to look at in on GitHub at:
[here](https://github.com/eriqande/con-gen-csu/blob/main/data/sample-array-info.tsv)

Something that would be really handy would be a little shell script
that would pick out a particular line of that file that corresponds to
the value in the `index` column and then define
some shell variables according to the columns names:
`index`,	`sample`,	`library`, `flowcell`, `platform`, `lane`, `barcode`, `fq1`, `fq2` so that they
could be used in an array script.

We have already seen some of the bash and `awk` machinery that would make that
possible, and we have wrapped it up in the `line-assign.sh` script.

### The `line-assign.sh` script

Within the repository is a script called `scripts/line-assign.sh`, that looks like this:
```{sh filename="Contents of scripts/line-assign.sh"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| file: ../scripts/line-assign.sh

```

Let's see what sorts of results this produces:
```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
 ./scripts/line-assign.sh 3 data/sample-array-info.tsv
```
Whoa! It returns a command line that assigns values to a lot of shell variables.

So, if we wanted to run that command line, we would have to precede it with
the `eval` keyword (because the command line itself includes special characters
like `=`).  Let's do that like this:
```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
COMM=$(./scripts/line-assign.sh 3 data/sample-array-info.tsv)
eval $COMM
```

Now, that you have done that, you can see that a lot of variables
have been assigned the values on the `index == 3` line of our TSV file:
```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
(
echo "index:      $index"
echo "sample:     $sample"
echo "library:    $library"
echo "platform:   $platform"
echo "lane:       $lane"
echo "barcode:    $barcode"
echo "fq1:        $fq1"
echo "fq2:        $fq2"
)
```

Holy Smokes! These are variables that we could use in a job array script.

In this case, we can assign values to the pesky Read Group string for `bwa mem`.

## Putting it all together: a read-mapping job array

We can now elaborate on our simple `bwa_map.sh` shell script
and turn that into a SLURM job array script.  The key here is that
when SLURM runs the script as a slurm array, there will be an environment
variable called `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` that we can use to pick out the
desired sample from the `data/sample-array-info.tsv` file.

Here is what it looks like:
```{sh filename="Contents of scripts/bwa_map_array.sh"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| file: ../scripts/bwa_map_array.sh

```

The main differences from our simple `bwa_map.sh` script are:

- The `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` is used to pick out the right line from our TSV
file of information
- The slurm output and error have been changed to use `%A_%a` notation.
- There is a `#SBATCH --array=1-16` directive, to run it over the 16 different files.
- The shell code that runs `bwa` and `samtools` uses  the variables that were
defined by `eval`-ing the results of the call to the `line-assign.sh` script.

You can launch that job array and see how it goes:
```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
sbatch scripts/bwa_map_array.sh
```
Then check with `myjobs` and `alljobs` to see what is happening on Sedna.

That runs really fast.

Afterward you can check that the results exist:
```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
ls -l results/mapped
```

And you can look at the logs for `bwa mem`:
```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
tail  results/log/bwa_map_array/bwa_mem_*
```

To see what one of the output files looks like, you can use samtools.  On Alpine, you
have to get onto a compute node to do that, so you would first do:
```{.sh filename="Do this if you are on the Alpine cluster"}
module load slurm/alpine
srun --partition=atesting --pty /bin/bash
```

Then do like this:
```{.sh filename="Paste this into your shell"}
module load samtools
samtools view results/mapped/DPCh_plate1_F10_S70.bam | less -S
```

Use the left and right arrows, and space bar and backspace to see all parts of the file.

Remember to hit `q` to get out of the `less` viewer.

## Wrap Up

So, that was a quick tour of the capabilities of `sbatch`.

Oddly enough, I haven't directly launched any jobs using `sbatch` (apart from the 
example jobs for this course) in many months, because I drive all my bioinformatics
projects using Snakemake, which sends my jobs to SLURM for me.

Eventually we will have an introduction to Snakemake!
